# Solar
The solar module is an interface that pulls in geo-positional data
and solar irradiation data from standard sources. It is also a
physically dimensioned/type safe module so users can input their
data in the most convenient system of units, e.g. metric or imperial 
for installation specifications; e.g. irradiance and panel area,
and atomic or SI for solar device data; e.g.
bandgaps in electron volts, photon conversion efficiency etc.

This allows for fast and safe transformation
between differents systems of units e.g. planar surface areas
measured in square feet, square meters, and energy values in kilowatts
or ergs or british thermal units.
